The VOiCES from a distance challenge will be focused on benchmarking and further improving state-of-the-art technologies
in the area of speaker recognition and automatic speech recognition (ASR) for far-field speech. The challenge is based on
the recently released corpus Voices Obscured on Complex Environmental Settings (VOiCES), were noisy speech was recorded in
real reverberant rooms with multiple microphones.  Noise sources included babble, music, or television. The challenge will
have two tracks for speaker recognition and ASR:
(i) Fixed System - Training data is limited to specific datasets
(ii) Open System - Participants can use any external datasets they have access to (private or public)
