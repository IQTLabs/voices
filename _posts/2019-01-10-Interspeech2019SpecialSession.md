SRI International and Lab41 will be hosting a special session at Interspeech 2019:
**The VOiCES from a Distance Challenge**.  This challenge will focus on benchmarking and further improving state-of-the-art technologies in the area of speaker recognition and automatic speech recognition (ASR) for far-field speech. VOiCES data from room-1 and room-2 will be available for participants to use as
training or development data. The final challenge evaluation will be done with data from room-3 and
room-4. You can find more information on the challenge [here](/Interspeech2019_SpecialSession.md).
