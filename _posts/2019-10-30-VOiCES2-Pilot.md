Lab41 and SRI International are excited to announce that the pilot collection of
VOiCES vol.2 has begun.  This new collection will build on the existing dataset
collecting data in real, reverberant rooms, multiple microphones at a distances
and distractors.  However, it will also deliver some new and unique features:
-  **Real conversations**: VOiCES II will collect conversations from up to four
people in a room, having real conversations.
- **Multi-modal**: For the new collection we will include microphones throughout
 the room as well as lapels for each speaker, lidar and color video of the scene
 and speakers.
- **Meta-data**: The dataset will include information on the speaker
demographics and full transcripts of the conversations with speaker tracking.
