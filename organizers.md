Zeb Armstrong is a Computer Scientist in SRI International’s Speech Technology and Research
(STAR) Laboratory. His main interest is preparing and transitioning speech technologies to fulfill
the needs of government and commercial users through software testing and user interface
design. He uses his experience with operational signals collection and audio processing to
anticipate clients’ needs and inform design decision.  Armstrong studied software engineering at 
Clarkson University before joining the US Army in 2013. While in the Army he worked as an
Arabic linguist and signals intelligence analyst, serving in both tactical and strategic capacities.
