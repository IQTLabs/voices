Maria Alejandra Barrios Garcia has been interested in math and science for as long as she can remember.

These days her experiments use laser-driven shock waves to turn polymers and other materials into ionized matter at “one of the best places to be doing this type of research”–the Laboratory for Laser Energetics. Her work, which revolves around extreme temperatures and pressures in a field known as high-energy density physics, is used in the University’s collaboration with the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in northern California.
Considering a postdoctoral fellowship at a laboratory in Europe, Barrios Garcia is weighing whether to follow that with a research position at a national lab or a teaching job at a university. Last summer she received an award from the American Association of Physics Teachers for her work as a teaching assistant in two general physics classes for nonscience majors.
For now, she feels in exactly the right place, surrounded by resources that keep her on the cutting edge of inertial confinement fusion, a major branch of fusion energy research.

### Karl Ni

Dr. Karl Ni is the Technical Director of Lab41, In-Q-Tel's AI and machine learning analytics laboratory. His interests lie in computer vision, audio signal processing, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Prior to In-Q-Tel, Dr. Ni served as principle investigator and program manager on laboratory directed programs at federally funded research and development centers, both MIT Lincoln Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Projects at these organizations included projects under the President's BRAIN initiative, the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, and internally funded projects. Dr. Ni received his doctoral degree from the University of California, San Diego under the advisement of Professor [Truong Nguyen](videoprocessing.ucsd.edu), with a thesis titled *Pattern Recognition Techniques for Image Processing*, and he received his bachelors degree from the University of California at Berkeley under the advisement of Avideh Zakhor.
