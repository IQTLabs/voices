## The Challenge

The VOiCES from a distance challenge will be focused on benchmarking and further improving state-of-the-art technologies
in the area of speaker recognition and automatic speech recognition (ASR) for far-field speech. The challenge will use the VOiCES data for development and evaluation. The challenge will have two tracks for speaker recognition and ASR:

(i) _Fixed System_ - Training data is limited to a subset of VOiCES, SITW, and VoxCeleb

(ii) _Open System_ - Participants can use any external datasets they have access to (private or public)
